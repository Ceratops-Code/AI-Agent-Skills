# Ceratops Credit Savings Analysis

This is the authoritative architecture and maintenance reference for the
`ceratops-credit-savings-analysis` skill. The operational instructions remain
in [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) and its action references. The versioned contract,
Python controller, and session collector own their respective executable
behavior; this document explains how they work together.

## 1 Purpose and goals

The skill analyzes retained Codex session evidence to find avoidable **model
calls** and avoidable context or output volume. Shell commands and tool calls
are supporting evidence; they are not the unit being counted. `quick-analysis`
uses a compact ledger for a bounded thread or recent-thread scan. The deep
controller analyzes one selected root thread and its retained descendants across
all surfaces or one named surface alone.

Its readers are operators running an analysis and maintainers changing the
controller. Operators need to know which sources are eligible, what gets
reviewed, and how to resume a run. Maintainers need to know which component owns
selection, capacity, model judgment, validation, transport, persistence, and
reporting.

The primary goals, in order, are:

1. Account for every model call in every selected completed run.
2. Preserve every confirmed finding and every known coverage omission.
3. Use model calls for semantic judgment while keeping selection, routing,
   copying, validation, accounting, retry, and persistence deterministic.
4. Prevent analysis from mutating the producer or workflow being analyzed.
5. Bound the analysis itself by proven context capacity and fixed attempt caps.
6. Resume safely after interruption without recollecting evidence or repeating
   accepted model work.

The skill does not apply recommendations, edit analyzed repositories, infer
savings from repeated commands alone, or classify a still-running turn as a
completed run. Its default chat presentation is limited to five
recommendations unless the user requests another limit; the complete machine
result keeps all confirmed findings.

## 2 Constraints and assumptions

The following constraints govern the deep controller. The quick action uses
the collector and its own action reference without Luna or Sol children.

- Analysis requests set `mutation_authority` to `false`.
- Deep and standalone surface runs use one exact root thread identity and include
  its retained descendants. Quick recent-thread selection freezes one UTC
  `as_of` boundary and a thread list before ledger review.
- Unfinished and archived threads are eligible. Completed runs inside them are
  analyzed; a currently running run is reported as unassessed.
- A completed run is the semantic unit. Oversized runs may be divided into the
  minimum ordered transport parts, then recombined as one run report.
- Luna discovery uses `gpt-5.6-luna`; Sol review and synthesis use
  `gpt-5.6-sol`. Both use maximum reasoning effort.
- The controller allows at most 70 Luna attempts with at most 15 concurrent
  Luna tasks. It plans at most 8 Sol calls and allows at most 16 Sol
  invocations, including corrective attempts.
- Invalid model output is rejected as a whole. The controller never truncates
  a valid result to make it fit.
- Before Luna launches, each Sol reviewer's candidate budget is divided among
  its assigned Luna tasks. Luna ranks supported issues and returns at most its
  frozen task limit. A part that reaches its limit is flagged in final
  accounting because lower-ranked issues may remain undiscovered. This bounds
  candidate decisions but does not prove that Sol's output will fit.
- All mutable state and retained evidence live below a caller-selected task
  temporary root. Requests bind the expected contract versions.
- The host must provide a working Codex executable, the declared models, Python,
  access to the local Codex thread index and session files, and the source
  working directories recorded by those sessions.

Capacity estimates assume the byte-to-token and reserve values in
[credit-analysis-contract.json](scripts/credit-analysis-contract.json). The
controller validates the current model catalog before planning. Those values
are conservative planning inputs, not a promise that a model provider will
never change its limits. Before admitting final deep-review evidence, the
controller subtracts the exact response-schema and prompt-framing bytes from
the proven input envelope.

## 3 System context

The deep analysis controller is a local, file-backed process. It reads session
and instruction evidence, launches read-only Codex child processes, validates
their structured results, and writes retained evidence and reports. The quick
action reads local session evidence through the collector and uses the
read-only recent-thread selector without model children.

```text
User / calling Codex thread
        |
        | request, execution, resume, final presentation
        v
Credit-analysis controller ----------------------+
        |                                         |
        | read                                    | launch with no-tools prompt,
        v                                         | read-only sandbox, explicit model
Codex thread index and session files              v
                                                  Luna and Sol Codex children
        ^                                         |
        | read effective rules and source cwd     | structured result/events/usage
        |                                         v
Source checkout and AGENTS chain          Task temporary artifact store
```

The local filesystem boundary contains potentially sensitive conversation,
tool, and instruction content. Model children receive only controller-prepared
evidence. They have no tools, no approval path, and a read-only sandbox. The
controller itself may read the selected sessions, their descendant sessions,
their source directories, and applicable instruction files; it has no
authority to edit the analyzed producer.

## 4 Solution strategy

The deep controller separates prioritized discovery from higher-precision
review:

1. Deterministic code selects threads and completed runs, collects evidence
   once, freezes identities and hashes, and plans capacity.
2. Luna reviews each admitted semantic run across all five waste surfaces and
   returns the strongest candidates within its frozen count limit, plus exact
   evidence references.
3. Sol reviewers adjudicate disjoint, frozen groups of Luna output. An optional
   focused recovery or direct-evidence review may run when deterministic signals
   and the call budget permit it.
4. A dependent final Sol call judges new candidates and deeply reviews the
   strongest findings; code ranks and assembles the result.
5. Deterministic code copies the complete accepted finding, risk, temporary
   control, classification, and evidence records into the final result. The
   final model is not responsible for reproducing those records.

This split matters because a language model can judge meaning but is an
unreliable bulk transport mechanism. Earlier assembly expected the final model
to repeat already accepted records; omissions then looked like new analytical
failures and prompted more diagnostic calls. The current design keeps the
judgment with the models and makes record transport controller-owned.

The fixed review surfaces are helper contracts, context and evidence reuse,
rework and validation, tool and handoff flow, and instruction and reasoning
flow. One Luna pass considers them together so a finding that crosses surfaces
is not split into unrelated partial findings.

## 5 Building blocks

### 5.1 C4 system and container view

The skill uses local Python helpers and task-owned files rather than separately
deployed services. The controller runs deep analysis; the session collector
supports ledger analysis without model orchestration.

| Container | Responsibility | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public instruction layer | Selects the public action, defines policy, completion, and presentation | [SKILL.md](SKILL.md), [quick-analysis.md](references/quick-analysis.md), and the other action references |
| Stable executable entry point | Keeps one script path while forwarding to modular implementation | [credit-analysis-workflow.py](scripts/credit-analysis-workflow.py) |
| CLI dispatcher | Parses analysis commands and composes quick batch collection and validation | [command_line_interface.py](scripts/credit_analysis/command_line_interface.py) |
| Surface contract and request core | Validates the contract, one root thread request, and shared artifact paths | [single_surface_analysis.py](scripts/credit_analysis/single_surface_analysis.py) |
| Session collector | Resolves active or archived sessions, descendant lineage, completed runs, model calls, token usage, and evidence references | [session_evidence_collector.py](scripts/credit_analysis/session_evidence_collector.py) |
| Source execution context | Resolves run working directories, recovers identity-matched deleted worktrees, and snapshots effective `AGENTS.md` text and hashes once | [source_execution_context.py](scripts/credit_analysis/source_execution_context.py) |
| Capacity planner | Partitions oversized runs, admits Luna tasks, assigns byte and candidate budgets to Sol reviewer bins, and enforces attempt capacity | [model_capacity_planning.py](scripts/credit_analysis/model_capacity_planning.py) |
| Model input preparation | Builds bounded evidence packets and compact final-review transport | [model_input_preparation.py](scripts/credit_analysis/model_input_preparation.py) |
| Model prompting | Builds Luna and Sol prompts, including prioritized discovery for count-bounded Luna tasks | [model_prompting.py](scripts/credit_analysis/model_prompting.py) |
| Holistic planner and assembler | Builds the current manifest and state, validates Luna/Sol domain results, freezes routing, reconciles judgments, and assembles the final machine result | [thread_review_orchestration.py](scripts/credit_analysis/thread_review_orchestration.py) |
| Attempt executor | Runs ready tasks concurrently, records attempts, normalizes mechanical Sol fields, applies narrow response corrections, retries diagnosed failures, records omissions, stops zero-review runs as incomplete, and checkpoints state | [orchestration_execution.py](scripts/credit_analysis/orchestration_execution.py) |
| Response contract | Builds closed model-output schemas, assigns canonical result-owned IDs, bounds explanatory classification rationale, and limits corrective responses to the rejected fields | [model_response_contract.py](scripts/credit_analysis/model_response_contract.py) |
| Final record transport | Copies and validates accepted source records so final synthesis cannot silently drop them | [report_bookkeeping.py](scripts/credit_analysis/report_bookkeeping.py) |
| Report renderer | Produces the compact human runs table while leaving full detail in machine evidence | [report_rendering.py](scripts/credit_analysis/report_rendering.py) |
| Artifact store | Persists request, evidence, manifest, state, attempt, routing, result, and report files | Caller-selected task temporary root |

### 5.2 Authority boundaries

The JSON contract owns deep-controller identifiers, fixed limits, models,
surface order, classifications, and controller actions. `SKILL.md` owns the
public action list; the controller actions must appear there in the same order.
Python owns field shape, cross-field rules, state transitions, persistence,
and failure behavior. The skill text owns operator-facing policy and
presentation. Tests establish which
behaviors have been exercised. This README is the authoritative explanation of
that design; it does not override the executable sources.

## 6 Runtime behavior

### Quick ledger analysis

`quick-analysis` uses `select-recent` when choosing threads by a recent day
interval. `quick-collect` reads each selected session once and derives its
completed-run suffix, usage, ledger, and redacted semantics from those same
rows. It uses the same frozen-window calculation as `quick-window`, excludes
the current scan unless explicitly included, and retains empty windows and
source failures. No full-thread intermediate files or analysis children are
created. The caller reviews the evidence and supplies classifications;
`quick-validate` rereads each ready source, requires the exact selected ledger
and semantics to remain unchanged, and reuses the collector's validation of
every call exactly once. Only accepted threads enter aggregate call and token
totals. The quick action retains findings and coverage gaps in caller-owned
evidence and presents at most three recommendations.

### 6.1 Fresh deep thread analysis

`run --request REQUEST` is the normal entry point for one root thread and its
retained descendants. It accepts the deep action or one named surface alone.

```text
validate request and contract
        -> resolve source and descendants
        -> collect completed-run evidence once
        -> freeze evidence, rule text and hashes, manifest, capacity, and state
        -> run admitted Luna tasks concurrently
        -> normalize mechanical Sol fields; validate each result; correct once or record an omission
        -> freeze Sol routing and exact byte allowances
        -> run Sol reviewers in parallel
        -> optionally run focused recovery or direct-evidence review
        -> ask final Sol only about new candidates and the selected top findings
        -> copy accepted judgments, apply revisions, and reconcile call accounting
        -> write machine result and compact report
        -> mark state complete
```

Planning assigns immutable task IDs, prompt and input hashes, execution working
directories, applicable rule-chain hashes, response schemas, and byte limits.
Luna starts from the verified working directory for the run it reviews. Sol
starts from the source thread's primary working directory and receives the text
of any run-local rules that differ from the primary rule chain.

Every retained model candidate receives one disposition. Every selected model
call receives a reviewed classification or remains explicitly unassessed. A
final Sol response contains only judgments missing from accepted earlier
reviews and evidence-backed revisions to the supplied top findings. The
controller carries earlier decisions and outcome records into the final result;
the model does not restate them. Code derives each candidate's disposition
from its finding and risk links.

A context-volume finding may be retained even when it saves no calls and is not
included in call-savings arithmetic. Evidence-supported avoidable model calls
remain in per-call classifications even without a recurring finding. The 3%
floor, rounded down against the frozen source-thread call count, prioritizes
recurring fixes; it does not discard observed one-off waste.

Final assembly reconciles final additions against earlier accepted results in
one controller pass. Earlier findings, classifications, risks, reviews, and
owner/control merges win incompatible restatements. A deep-review revision can
change a finding's status or move a call to one complete replacement finding
when the revised call judgments remain consistent. An incompatible revision
reverts to the accepted finding and call judgments. An incompatible new finding
is omitted and its new candidate link is removed; a linked temporary-control
review records why no finding was retained. Exact duplicates are deduplicated.
The finalizer derives the observed affected-call count after consolidation.
The raw final response remains available as attempt evidence. Missing coverage
and contradictions inside accepted source results still fail validation; the
controller does not manufacture a finding to conceal them.

### 6.2 Correction, retry, and omission

Call `command_execute_orchestration(..., stop_on_validation_error=True)` when
the requester wants execution to stop at the first rejected model result. This
mode runs tasks serially and preserves the rejected attempt for diagnosis
without launching its corrective retry.

The response schema is closed. Before Sol validation, the controller assigns
canonical IDs to result-owned findings, risks, and temporary-control reviews,
rewrites their internal references, and bounds only explanatory classification
rationale. The raw response remains unchanged as attempt evidence, and the
classification and reason code remain intact. Ambiguous identifiers still fail
normal validation rather than being guessed.

When a model response fails validation, the controller derives a correction
schema that permits changes only at the rejected paths and verifies that every
other value remains unchanged. A valid retained corrected result can complete
the task without a new model call.

Each Luna task gets at most one smaller-output retry for a diagnosed output
size or schema failure. Each rejected Sol task gets one corrective retry while
the global Sol attempt cap permits it. If validation still fails, the
controller records the exact task, call inventory, byte inventory, and reason
as omitted or unassessed and continues when the workflow can still produce an
honest final result. If eligible calls exist but no Sol reviewer result was
accepted, the controller stops at phase `incomplete`, skips final synthesis,
and publishes no complete result.

Sibling attempts that finished before one concurrent failure are checkpointed
before that failure is surfaced. Timeouts and interruption terminate the child
process tree rather than leaving an untracked model process running. Sol children
time out after 600 seconds; Luna keeps its 1,200-second timeout. A Sol timeout
with no result is checkpointed and retried once with the same frozen task when
the existing Sol attempt cap permits. A second timeout stops the run. Other
runner failures do not receive this retry. The extra attempt can increase model
call spend, and a valid Sol response taking over ten minutes may be cut off.

### 6.3 Resume and idempotency

Running the same request again finds its existing state and enters `execute`
instead of planning again. Before reuse, the controller revalidates request and
contract hashes, evidence, the retained rule snapshot's internal text and
hashes, prompt identity, task input, schema, and complete attempt artifacts. It
does not reopen live `AGENTS.md` files after planning, so later instruction
changes do not invalidate accepted or pending analysis tasks. Accepted tasks
are not launched again. Incomplete or conflicting artifacts block the resume
because their identity cannot be proved.

State writes are checkpointed atomically. Result files are write-once in
meaning: an existing file is accepted only when its content matches the
expected identity and hash. `plan` stops after planning, `execute --state`
continues a frozen plan, and `orchestration-status --state` reads public status
without launching models.

### 6.4 Quick recent-thread selection

`select-recent --days DAYS --output OUTPUT` writes
recent thread identities, sessions, index fingerprint, and exclusions to a
caller-owned file. It does not prepare controller tasks or launch models.
`--as-of` can freeze an exact UTC boundary; otherwise selection uses the
invocation time. The action using the selection owns the output file's cleanup.
`quick-window` reads collector usage evidence and returns a compact completed
run count for the same boundary and day interval. It rejects a noncontiguous
run window instead of widening the scan.

`quick-collect --selection SELECTION --output BATCH` writes
`ceratops-credit-quick-batch.v1` with the original selection and one record per
thread. Each record is `ready`, `excluded-current`, `no-completed-runs`, or
`unassessed`. Ready records contain `ledger`, `semantic`, `usage`, `summary`,
and the collected source fingerprint. The original index fingerprint, project
metadata, and source fingerprint are provenance annotations; live validation
compares the selected ledger and semantics instead of rejecting irrelevant
changes outside the selected window. `--include-current` is an explicit caller
override. `--pricing-profile` uses the collector's existing pricing contract.

`quick-validate --batch BATCH --classifications CLASSIFICATIONS --output RESULT`
accepts `ceratops-credit-quick-classifications.v1`: a `threads` list of objects
with `thread_id` and `classification`, where `classification` is the existing
collector input described by the batch's `classification_input`. Duplicate or
out-of-batch identities reject the request. Missing classifications, invalid
call coverage, unavailable sources, and changed windows become per-thread
`unassessed` results. `ceratops-credit-quick-result.v1` retains these gaps and
accepted classifications with aggregate counts and tokens for validated threads
only. It does not infer semantic correctness from successful validation.

Both commands refuse output overwrite, require an existing output directory,
and print compact counts and the output path. Batch and result files belong to
the caller for incremental review and eventual cleanup; the helper creates no
temporary files. A failed source does not discard successfully collected or
validated peers. Exact-source quick reviews retain the individual collector
workflow.

## 7 Deployment and operations

The skill is source-controlled as one directory. The repository deployment
script copies the entire directory, so this README is automatically included
when the skill is deployed to
`$CODEX_HOME/skills/ceratops-credit-savings-analysis`. No separate runtime
payload declaration is needed for skill-local files.

Deployment changes the installed skill only when the repository lifecycle
workflow is explicitly asked to promote and deploy. Running from a development
worktree can use that worktree's `scripts/credit-analysis-workflow.py` directly
without deploying it.

The controller is a local Python program and launches the local `codex`
executable as child processes. Its primary configuration is the versioned
contract plus the request JSON. `CODEX_HOME` locates local Codex state;
`CODEX_THREAD_ID` is required only for the `current-thread` selector. Progress
comes from controller stdout and retained state, event, attempt, and usage
files. Successful payload-free commands print `OK`; status and run commands
print compact JSON.

Retained analysis artifacts are operational evidence and remain below the task
root. The controller removes only its declared transient files at their
cleanup trigger. The caller owns eventual removal of the retained task root.

## 8 Cross-cutting design

### 8.1 Data and persistence

The workflow uses JSON, JSONL, Markdown, and child event files. There is no
database and no hidden in-memory source of truth after a checkpoint.

The main artifact groups are:

- **Input:** request, optional pricing profile, exact source and selection
  boundary.
- **Frozen evidence:** normalized session evidence, semantic completed runs,
  call and token inventories, canonical source snapshots, descendant lineage,
  execution working directories, and effective rule-chain hashes.
- **Plan:** orchestration state, chunk manifest, Luna tasks, Sol routing,
  response schemas, byte allowances, and task order.
- **Attempts:** prompt, input, native session identity, events, raw response,
  validated response, latency, and usage for every launched child.
- **Results:** accepted Luna and Sol outputs, omission inventory, final machine
  result, and compact human report.

Immutable artifacts are bound by path and SHA-256 or content hashes. Atomic
state replacement makes the latest checkpoint the resume point. Schema tags
make incompatible artifacts fail explicitly; there is no automatic migration
between schema versions. Retaining an old task root therefore also requires
retaining the compatible skill version if that analysis must be resumed.

#### Schema and version registry

Every `*_schema` value in the contract is a **type and version discriminator**
stored in an artifact's `schema` field. It is not a JSON Schema filename, URL,
or executable definition. Python builds or checks the actual closed field
shape and validates that the discriminator exactly matches the contract.

| Contract key | Artifact and active consumer |
| --- | --- |
| `schema` | Identifies the contract document itself as `ceratops-credit-analysis-contract.v1`. |
| `request_schema` | Single-thread request accepted by the evidence and holistic controllers. |
| `evidence_schema` | Retained normalized analysis evidence. |
| `canonical_state_schema` | Read-only canonical implementation snapshot used by the deep controller. |
| `orchestration_state_schema` | Resumable state for the current holistic controller. |
| `chunk_manifest_schema` | Frozen semantic-run parts, task identities, assignments, and capacity plan for the current controller. |
| `luna_result_schema` | Validated count-bounded discovery result for one admitted semantic run or ordered run part. |
| `adjudication_result_schema` | Validated Sol reviewer or final synthesis result. |
| `orchestration_final_schema` | Final machine result for one root thread and its retained descendants. |
| `routing_manifest_schema` | Frozen assignment of accepted Luna output and candidates to Sol tasks. |

The numeric `surface_contract_version` binds action and policy changes to
each request before planning. It is separate from artifact schema versions.

### 8.2 APIs and integrations

The public executable interface is:

```text
python scripts/credit-analysis-workflow.py run --request REQUEST
python scripts/credit-analysis-workflow.py plan --request REQUEST
python scripts/credit-analysis-workflow.py execute --state STATE
python scripts/credit-analysis-workflow.py orchestration-status --state STATE
python scripts/credit-analysis-workflow.py select-recent --days DAYS --output OUTPUT [--as-of UTC]
python scripts/credit-analysis-workflow.py quick-window --days DAYS --as-of UTC --usage-evidence FILE
python scripts/credit-analysis-workflow.py quick-collect --selection SELECTION --output BATCH
python scripts/credit-analysis-workflow.py quick-validate --batch BATCH --classifications CLASSIFICATIONS --output RESULT
```

The CLI parser owns the exact command set. The JSON contract governs deep
controller requests and result versions; quick selection uses its own
caller-owned output.

Requests and results are local files. There is no remote service API or
authentication exchange. Child Codex processes use the host's existing Codex
authentication and model availability. Each launch has an explicit model,
maximum reasoning effort, read-only sandbox, no approvals, self-contained
no-tools prompt, response schema, timeout handling, and controller-owned event
and result paths.

### 8.3 Security and resilience

The controller enforces task-root path containment, rejects unsafe or
conflicting artifacts, validates regular files and symlinks, freezes contract
and instruction hashes, and sets mutation authority to false. Child prompts
cannot call tools and child processes run read-only. Missing source worktrees
can map to a primary checkout only when canonical topology and the retained and
live Git repository URLs prove the same repository identity.

Session evidence can contain private conversation, source snippets, command
text, tool output, local paths, and instruction files. The task root must be
treated as sensitive local data. The controller uses path-reduced semantic
evidence for model transport where supported, but retained machine evidence is
not a general-purpose redaction product.

Reliability comes from immutable identities, closed schemas, atomic
checkpoints, write-or-verify publication, bounded retries, explicit omissions,
and process-tree termination. There is no independent backup service. The
retained task root is the recovery record; if it is deleted, the analysis must
be planned again. Provider or host outages remain external dependencies and are
reported rather than hidden by unlimited retries.

## 9 Decisions and alternatives

| Decision | Status and reason | Alternative rejected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Count model calls as the savings unit | Accepted. Credits are consumed by model calls; commands are evidence about why a call happened. | Counting repeated commands as waste, which confuses tool activity with credit consumption. |
| Admit unfinished and archived threads | Accepted. Thread lifecycle is independent of whether it contains completed runs that can be reviewed. | Requiring task completion, which silently discards eligible evidence. |
| Keep completed runs as semantic units | Accepted. User intent, corrections, results, and validation form one causal episode. | Reviewing independent calls or commands, which loses the reason a call was necessary. |
| Use Luna discovery followed by Sol review | Accepted. It combines ranked candidate selection with stronger adjudication under explicit limits. | One large synthesis call, which is harder to fit, validate, and recover. |
| Analyze all surfaces together | Accepted. Cross-surface causes and fixes remain connected. | One model pass per surface, which multiplies calls and creates duplicate findings. |
| Make the controller own accepted-record transport | Accepted. Models judge and summarize; code preserves exact accepted findings, classifications, evidence, and references. | Asking the final model to copy every accepted record, which can omit valid results and cause avoidable diagnostic reruns. |
| Preserve semantic output; bound explanatory rationale deterministically | Accepted. Raw responses remain immutable, result-owned IDs are canonicalized, and only explanatory rationale is bounded before validation. | Rejecting an otherwise valid classification for overlong prose, which spends retries and loses coverage. |
| Persist file-backed state after each boundary | Accepted. It supports inspection and idempotent resume without a service. | Memory-only orchestration or a database service, which adds operational complexity. |
| Keep one model-orchestrated thread path | Accepted. Deep analysis and each named surface use the same one-root-thread controller. | A second sequential interface, which duplicates state and validation rules. |
| Keep analysis read-only | Accepted. Findings must not change the evidence or producer they assess. | Automatic remediation, which would mix diagnosis, authorization, and mutation. |

## 10 Quality scenarios

These are required behavior targets; passing tests or retained run evidence is
needed to claim a measured result.

| Scenario | Stimulus and condition | Expected response and threshold | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Deterministic recent-days selection | The same index and UTC `as_of` are selected twice | The frozen selected thread IDs and order are identical; active and archived session locations are eligible | Quick selector behavior test |
| Quick batch validation | Some sources fail, change, or have incomplete classifications | Preserve per-source gaps and count only unchanged, fully classified threads without child model calls | Quick batch CLI behavior tests |
| Bounded quick window | A selected thread has older and recent completed runs | The quick path returns only the recent completed-run suffix for `--last-runs` and rejects a noncontiguous window | Quick-window CLI behavior test |
| Unfinished-thread coverage | A selected active thread contains completed runs and one running run | All completed runs enter evidence; the running run is reported unassessed | Session collector and thread tests |
| Bounded discovery | Prepared evidence exceeds one Luna input but fits the global budget | The minimum ordered parts are admitted, no more than 15 run concurrently, and attempts never exceed 70 | Capacity and orchestration tests plus state totals |
| Invalid Luna output | A Luna result violates schema or its byte allowance | The exact task is retried at most once with a smaller allowance, then omitted with identity, bytes, and reason | Response and retry tests |
| Invalid Sol output | A Sol result contains noncanonical result-owned IDs, oversized explanatory rationale, or a remaining schema or semantic violation | Code repairs deterministic IDs and references and bounds rationale without a retry; only diagnosed remaining fields or claims may change; an invalid temporary-control ROI subclaim is detached without withdrawing its independent finding; at most one corrective retry is used per task; zero accepted reviewers end at `incomplete`; and total Sol invocations never exceed 16 | Mechanical-normalization, correction-scope, zero-review, and attempt-budget tests |
| Interrupted run | The controller stops after some sibling tasks complete | Completed siblings are checkpointed; resume reuses accepted outputs and launches only proven pending work | Resume and sibling-failure tests |
| No silent copying loss | Final Sol returns synthesis judgments after reviewers accepted findings | Controller assembly contains every accepted source record exactly once or fails validation | Report bookkeeping and finalization tests |
| Honest capacity shortfall | A run part or reviewer cannot fit or validate within limits | Final coverage is incomplete and the exact omitted calls, records, and bytes are retained; no zero is substituted for unreviewed work | Omission and final-accounting tests |
| Read-only analysis | Deep or standalone surface analysis runs | No analyzed producer file is changed and every child uses a read-only sandbox with no tools | Command construction tests and source-worktree status |

## 11 Risks and limitations

- **Model judgment remains probabilistic.** Closed schemas prove shape and
  identity, not the truth of a semantic conclusion. Cross-model review,
  evidence references, and direct verification reduce this risk.
- **Capacity can force omissions.** The controller records them, but a report
  with omissions is not semantically complete. Larger source histories may
  require a narrower selection or later continuation.
- **Local session availability is required.** Missing or malformed thread-index
  records, session files, source directories, or instruction chains can exclude
  or block planning. Identity-matched worktree recovery covers only canonical
  deleted-worktree cases. After planning, retained instruction text is the
  immutable analysis snapshot; later live edits do not block execution.
- **The model catalog and real provider envelopes can change.** Planning checks
  the live catalog and uses reserves, but external limit changes can still
  cause a bounded failure.
- **Retained evidence is sensitive and can be large.** There is no automatic
  archival, encryption, or expiry policy beyond local filesystem controls and
  caller-owned cleanup.
- **Pricing is optional.** Call and token accounting remains available without
  a pricing profile, but monetary savings cannot be complete.
- **Compact human reports omit detail by design.** The machine result and
  retained evidence are required for full findings, classifications, coverage,
  and provenance.
- **Quick analysis is a focused ledger review.** Its 80% highest-call minimum
  prioritizes inspection; a call lacking semantic evidence is not reported as
  classified.

## 12 Glossary and references

- **Model call:** One non-empty assistant response recorded in selected session
  evidence and assigned a stable call ID.
- **Completed run:** A finished user turn and its resulting model and tool
  activity, treated as one semantic episode.
- **Unfinished thread:** A task that may still be active but can contain earlier
  completed runs eligible for review.
- **Surface:** One of the five fixed perspectives used to search for credit
  waste.
- **Luna task:** A count-bounded discovery review of one complete semantic run or
  one ordered part of an oversized run.
- **Sol reviewer:** A higher-precision adjudication task over a frozen subset of
  accepted Luna output.
- **Final Sol:** The dependent synthesis task that merges judgments and expands
  the strongest findings; it does not own bulk copying of accepted records.
- **Temporary control:** A run-local or provisional mechanism whose durability
  must be assessed separately from the finding it accompanies.
- **Omission:** Evidence or a task that could not be admitted or accepted within
  the frozen capacity, schema, or retry contract.
- **Schema tag:** An exact artifact type/version string checked against the
  contract; the field shape is enforced by Python.
- **Task root:** The caller-selected temporary directory containing one
  resumable analysis and its retained evidence.

## 13 Testing and verification

Behavior tests under [tests/credit_analysis](../../tests/credit_analysis/)
cover source selection, evidence collection, schema validation, capacity
planning, Luna and Sol routing, output correction, retries, resume,
report preservation, and failure accounting. Changes should run
the narrowest existing test nodes that cover each modified behavior before any
broader suite.

The design-document validator checks this file's metadata, mapped sections,
local links, declared source paths, fenced blocks, and diagram syntax when
applicable. It does not prove semantic agreement with the controller. A design
review must compare changed runtime behavior with this document, the contract,
the applicable action reference, and the behavior tests.

Operational verification for an actual analysis comes from retained state:
controller status must report completion; every admitted Luna and Sol task must
have a terminal disposition; every call must be classified or explicitly
unassessed; and the machine result must retain the omission and accounting
inventories. A clean report alone is insufficient completion evidence.

## 14 Ownership and maintenance

The maintainers of `ceratops-credit-savings-analysis` own this document. Its
authoritative path is
`skills/ceratops-credit-savings-analysis/README.md`. The root repository README
contains only a relative discoverability link; installed copies are deployment
artifacts rather than the editing source.

When an update trigger in the metadata fires, review the change in this order:

1. Update executable policy in the contract or behavior in the owning Python
   module.
2. Update the operational skill or action reference when user-facing behavior
   changed.
3. Update this README's affected architecture, flow, schema, quality, risk, and
   verification sections.
4. Update the narrowest existing behavior tests.
5. Validate the document and its local links, then deploy through the normal
   skill and repository lifecycle only when deployment is requested.

If the README conflicts with executable behavior, treat that as documentation
drift: verify the code and contract, then update the README in the same change.
Do not patch an installed copy directly.
